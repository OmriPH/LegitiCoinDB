# LegitiCoinDB
This is the source code for the LegitiCoinDB (Minecraft Client Mod, API, Minecraft Paper Server Plugin)

`LCoinDB` -> Minecraft Client Mod for Fabric

`LcoinDB-Server` -> Minecraft Paper Server Plugin for Authenticating

`LegitiCoinDB-server` -> node.js API for the Minecraft Client Mod

(I know the directories are badly named)

## TODO List
- Rename directories/projects to be more descriptive
- Make some way to get the "top 10" players
- Clean up code for the `/lcoin` command (split into multiple files maybe?)
- Make error messages on the client better (not just sending the raw json response into the chat if somehthing goes wrong)
- Rate limit the API
- Make translations for the Mod instead of hardcoding the texts
